              How do wind turbines and solar panels work together in a renewable
              energy system?
            </p>
            <p>
              Wind turbines and solar panels generate electricity through
              different mechanisms. Wind turbines harness the kinetic energy of
              the wind to turn blades, which then drive a generator. Solar
              panels convert sunlight into electricity through the photovoltaic
              effect. When integrated into a renewable energy system, these
              technologies complement each other by providing a continuous and
              reliable power supply. Wind power is often more abundant during
              certain times, while solar power is consistent during daylight
              hours, resulting in a more stable overall energy output.
